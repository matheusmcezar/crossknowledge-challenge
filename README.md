# Technical challenge

Here is the description of what you'll need to implement and answer on this technical challenge.

# Challenges

You'll answer the 4 following challenges.

## 1. Cache function
Implement a function (on the same module - `request.php`) to cache requests preventing unecessary calls. You may use [this Redis module](https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis) as a cache service.

**Note**: You may use any PHP version, including PHP7+.

## 2. Date formatting
Implement a JavaScript code (on the same file - `date-format.html`) that replaces the date value of all elements (that have `js-date-format` class) with the value of the time passed from now (`new Date()`). Use the following format:
* 1 second ago OR X seconds ago
* 1 minute ago OR X minutes ago
* 1 hour ago OR X hours ago
* Date in ISO format (original format)

Example:

**Note**: You should use ecmascript 6 features but may not use any framework or add any dependency.

## 3. Apply style
Implement the CSS code to make the component on `component.html` look like the desired mockup below.

Mockup:
